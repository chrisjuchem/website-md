*Node* was initially developed in 48-hours for the 2017 [Global Game Jam](https://globalgamejam.org/)
to fit the jam's theme of "Waves". It will forever hold a special place in my
heart as one of my first collaborative game projects, and the first time I
used the Unity Game Engine, and when I first learned how to properly use git.

The game won **Best Design** and was first runner-up for **Best College Alpha**
at the [2017 MassDiGI Game Challenge](https://www.massdigi.org/sip-blog/massdigi-2017-game-challenge-results/).

The game was eventually expanded, polished, and put on the Apple App Store.
It is unfortunately no longer available there, but it can still be played on
[itch.io](https://trevday.itch.io/node-gravity-waves). There is also
a [youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyrCmenTGFo) available
of the game as it was just after the game jam.
