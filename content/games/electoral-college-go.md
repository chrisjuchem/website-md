*Electoral College Go* explores how the ancient game of *Go* changes when not
every point on the board is equal (just like American votes). Players compete
not over individual points, but the states of the U.S., where the player controls
more intersections will earn ***all*** of the state's points.

The unique board shape adds some new tactics to the game, but what I find the
most interesting about the game is how drastically different the move order can
feel from normal *Go*.

When I play *Go*, I have a strong intuition about the "correct" flow of a game just
from watching how so many games have played out. Players generally move from the 
corners, to the sides, and then to the center, blocking out large areas before finally
settling all the exact borders in the endgame. In *Electoral College Go*, sometimes
a move on the edge of the board or on a dame point is vital for flipping an entire 
state from one player to the other, and so it gets played much earlier than one
would normally expect. It's often a challenge to even spot these moves (let alone
evaluate them) once our brains have trained so long on typical *Go* that we begin 
to subconsciously ignore these sorts of moves during the middle-game.

I find it very fun to be challenged on these fundamental aspects of one's knowledge.
Will you be able to prove that you have a deep understanding of Go tactics, or have
you become too reliant on subconscious shortcuts to play anything but standard 19x19?
